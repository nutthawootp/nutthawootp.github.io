# Design Document

## Overview

The personal portfolio website will be built as a single-page application (SPA) using React.js with Vite.js as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. The design follows modern web development practices with a focus on performance, accessibility, and responsive design.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite.js for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Routing:** React Router (if multi-page navigation is needed)
- **Icons:** React Icons or Heroicons
- **Animations:** Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions

- Project cards with hover effects
- Filter/category system (optional)
- Modal or detailed view for project information

#### Contact Section

- Contact information display
- Social media links with icons
- Contact form with validation
- Location information (optional)

### Data Interfaces

```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  technologies: string[];
  imageUrl: string;
  liveUrl?: string;
  githubUrl: string;
  featured: boolean;
}

interface Skill {
  name: string;
  category: 'frontend' | 'backend' | 'tools' | 'other';
  level: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  icon?: string;
}

interface PersonalInfo {
  name: string;
  title: string;
  bio: string;
  email: string;
  location: string;
  socialLinks: {
    github: string;
    linkedin: string;
    twitter?: string;
  };
}
```

## Data Models

### Content Management

- Static data files in TypeScript for easy maintenance
- Centralized configuration for personal information
- Modular project data structure for easy updates
- Skill categorization system

### State Management

- React hooks for local component state
- Context API for global state (if needed)
- Custom hooks for scroll spy functionality
- Form state management with controlled components

## Error Handling

### Form Validation

- Client-side validation for contact form
- Real-time feedback for form fields
- Error message display with clear instructions
- Success confirmation after form submission

### Image Loading

- Lazy loading for project images
- Fallback images for broken links
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Optimized image formats (WebP with fallbacks)

### Network Resilience

- Graceful degradation for missing assets
- Error boundaries for component failures
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Component testing with React Testing Library and Vitest
- Utility function testing with Vitest
- Custom hook testing with @testing-library/react-hooks
- Form validation testing with React Testing Library user events
- Snapshot testing for stable components

### Integration Testing

- Navigation flow testing
- Form submission testing
- Responsive design testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Performance Testing

- Lighthouse audits for performance metrics
- Bundle size analysis
- Image optimization verification
- Loading time measurements

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints (Tailwind CSS)

- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

### Layout Adaptations

- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid systems
- Scalable typography
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

## Performance Optimizations

### Build Optimizations

- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Asset optimization with Vite
- Gzip compression for production builds

### Runtime Optimizations

- Image lazy loading with native loading="lazy"
- Smooth scrolling with CSS scroll-behavior and custom animations
- Debounced scroll event handlers in useScrollSpy
- CSS-based animations with configurable delays
- IntersectionObserver for efficient scroll tracking
- Memoization for expensive calculations

## Accessibility Features

### WCAG Compliance

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for all images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader compatibility

### Interactive Elements

- Focus indicators
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Skip navigation links
- Accessible form labels and error messages

## Deployment Strategy

### Hosting

- GitHub Pages for static hosting
- The link to the repository will be:
  - <https://github.com/nutthawootp/nutthawootp.github.io>

- The link to the live site will be:
  - <https://nutthawootp.github.io>

### CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments
- Workflow triggers on push to main branch
- Build steps include linting, testing, and production build generation
- Deployment step to push the build to GitHub Pages

### Version Control

- Git for version control
- Branching strategy: main for production, develop for staging, feature branches for new features

### UI/UX design

- the design is inspired by modern portfolio websites with a clean, minimalistic aesthetic as shown in the image below.
